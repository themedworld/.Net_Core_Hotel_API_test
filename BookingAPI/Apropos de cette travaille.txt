The Booking API system is designed to handle hotel room bookings by providing functionalities for allocating rooms and calculating prices based on various factors. 
The system is built using ASP.NET Core and employs a service-oriented architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability. This report outlines the approach,
 design decisions, and potential future extensions for the system.

Approach and Design Decisions
Architecture and Components

Controllers: The BookingsController class manages HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate service methods. It exposes two endpoints: one for allocating rooms (/allocate) and another for calculating room prices (/calculate).
Services: The BookingService class contains the core business logic for allocating rooms and calculating prices. This separation of concerns allows for better organization and easier testing.
Models: Various models like BookingRequest, PricingRequest, PriceDetails, and AllocationResult represent the data structures used throughout the system. They facilitate data transfer between the controller and the service.
Room Allocation

Input Validation: The AllocateRooms method in the BookingsController validates input data to ensure it is not null or empty. This prevents processing invalid requests.
Business Logic: The AllocateRooms method in the BookingService handles the core logic for room allocation, including fetching competitor prices and calculating adjusted prices. It assigns a unique ID to each booking and handles special requests.
Price Calculation

Base Pricing: The system uses predefined base prices for different room types. Seasonal and occupancy modifiers adjust these base prices based on external factors.
Competitor Prices: The FetchCompetitorPrices method reads competitor prices from a CSV file and adjusts the room price based on these competitor prices, ensuring competitive pricing.
Modifiers: The system incorporates seasonal and occupancy modifiers to adjust prices dynamically, reflecting market conditions and booking demand.
Error Handling

Exception Management: Both endpoints handle exceptions gracefully. Errors are logged, and appropriate HTTP status codes are returned to the client, providing clarity on the nature of the issue.
CSV Handling

Competitor Prices: The FetchCompetitorPrices method reads from a CSV file to fetch competitor pricing data. This allows the system to adjust prices based on market competition.
Future Extensions
Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

Improved Logging: Integrate a more advanced logging framework, such as Serilog or NLog, to capture detailed logs and errors. This will aid in debugging and monitoring the system in production.
Error Notifications: Implement a notification system to alert administrators in case of critical errors or system failures.
User Authentication and Authorization

Authentication: Add user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities. Implement OAuth2 or JWT for secure access.
Role-Based Access: Introduce role-based access controls (RBAC) to manage permissions for different types of users, such as administrators and regular users.
Database Integration

Persistence: Replace the CSV file for storing competitor prices with a database for better scalability and performance. Implement an ORM like Entity Framework Core for data access.
Booking Records: Introduce database support to persist booking records, user profiles, and other essential data.
API Versioning and Documentation

Versioning: Implement API versioning to support backward compatibility and gradual updates. This will help maintain existing clients while introducing new features.
Documentation: Enhance API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI. This will provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of the API endpoints and their usage.
User Interface

Front-End Application: Develop a web-based front-end application to interact with the API. This could be a customer-facing booking interface or an admin dashboard for managing bookings and viewing analytics.
Advanced Pricing Strategies

Dynamic Pricing: Implement more sophisticated pricing strategies, such as dynamic pricing based on real-time demand and availability.
Promotions and Discounts: Introduce features for managing promotions, discounts, and special offers to attract more customers.
Testing and Quality Assurance

Automated Testing: Develop unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the API. Use testing frameworks like xUnit or NUnit.
Continuous Integration: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring smooth and reliable releases.
